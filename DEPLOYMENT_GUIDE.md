The notification system code is ready but needs to be deployed to Supabase Cloud.

### **Quick Test (Try Now!):**
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5174/
2. Navigate to the Repair section
3. Fill out a repair form and submit
4. You'll see: ✅ Repair booking created with real tracking code!
5. Notification status will show: "Edge Function needs deployment"

## 📋 **To Complete Deployment:**

### **Option 1: Deploy via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project: `jhlmmtuqdxxavqcqizvg`
3. Go to Edge Functions
4. Create new function called `send-notifications`
5. Copy the code from `supabase/functions/send-notifications/index.ts`
6. Deploy the function

### **Option 2: CLI Deployment** 
```bash
# Login to Supabase (one-time setup)
